This is the android client for [owncloud][0].

This client is for file syncronization.  Other OwnCloud features may be added in the future, but they are not a priority right now.

For Calendar and Contacts sync, users can use any CalDAV and CardDAV clients they prefer.  For example, [aCal](http://acal.me/wiki/Main_Page) is a fully functional Calendar app.

Make sure you read [SETUP.md][1] when you start working on this project.
