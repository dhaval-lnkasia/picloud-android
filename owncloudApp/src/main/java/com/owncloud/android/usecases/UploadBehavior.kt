/**
 * Behavior of the file to upload.
 *
 * COPY_TO_TEMPORAL_AND_UPLOAD - Make a temporal file before uploading.
 * MOVE_TO_NEW_PLACE - Source file is potentially in a wrong place inside owncloud local storage and needs to be moved to a new one.
 * FORGET - Upload the file to server(normally a cached one) and do not keep a copy in the local storage.
 *
 * By default, the file will be copied. We do not want to remove the file without user approval.
 *
 * Analog to the old LOCAL_BEHAVIOUR but with fixed options.
 * Warning -> Order of elements is really important. The ordinal is used to store the value in the database.
