Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and convenient, as you can use any Web browser on any operating system without installing special client software.
However, the ownCloud Android app offers some advantages over the Web interface:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on a tablet or smartphone
* Automatic synchronization of your files
* Share files with other ownCloud users and groups, and create multiple public share links
* Upload of photos and videos recorded on your Android device
* Easily add files from your device to ownCloud
* Two-factor authentication
