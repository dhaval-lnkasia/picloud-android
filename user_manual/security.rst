Security
========

Passcode Locks & Pins
---------------------

You can also set a passcode lock to further protect your files and folders.
And, if you want extra security, you can set a login PIN on your Android device, and also on your ownCloud account.
If you are using a shared Android device, other users can access your files in the file manager if you are sharing a single user account.
To avoid this, you could set up multiple user accounts to protect your files.

The bottom section of the *"Settings"* screen has links to:

- Help
- Recommend to a friend
- Feedback
- The version number

Pattern Lock and Fingerprint Lock
---------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.7.0

In addition to the Passcode Lock and Pins, you also have the ability to use both a pattern and a fingerprint lock to protect access to your ownCloud app and its data.
To enable one or both, under *"Settings"* -> *"Security"*, choose which one(s) you want to enable.

.. note:: To use the Fingerprint Lock, the Pattern Lock has to be enabled.

After you enable the pattern lock, you will need to create a pattern and then confirm it to access the ownCloud app, just as you would if you've enabled that for access to the phone itself.
If you later disable pattern lock, you will need to enter your pattern again.

If you enable the fingerprint lock, you will need to provide one of your already stored fingerprint patterns to access the ownCloud app.

.. note::
   If fingerprint lock is enabled, but you donâ€™t want to use it, you can cancel
   the fingerprint lock prompt and fallback to using the pattern lock instead.
