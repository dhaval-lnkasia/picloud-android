Passcode Locks & Pins
---------------------

You can also set a passcode lock to further protect your files and folders.
And, if you want extra security, you can set a login PIN on your Android device, and also on your ownCloud account.
If you are using a shared Android device, other users can access your files in the file manager if you are sharing a single user account.
To avoid this, you could set up multiple user accounts to protect your files.

The bottom section of the *"Settings"* screen has links to:

- Help
- Recommend to a friend
- Feedback
- The version number
