Welcome to the PiCloud Android App – Add an PiCloud server, and have your private file sync and share cloud up and running in no time.

Do you need private file sync and share software? Then good news, because the PiCloud Android App enables you to connect Android devices to a private PiCloud Server running in your data center. PiCloud is open source file sync and share software for everyone from individuals operating the free PiCloud server, to large enterprises and service providers operating under the PiCloud Enterprise Subscription. PiCloud provides a safe, secure and compliant file sync and share solution – on servers you control.

With the PiCloud Android App you can browse all of your PiCloud synced files, create and edit new files, share these files and folders with co-workers, and keep the contents of those folders in sync across all of your devices. Simply copy a file into a directory on your server and PiCloud does the rest.

Whether using a mobile device, a desktop, or the web client, PiCloud provides the ability to put the right files in the right hands at the right time on any device in one simple-to-use, secure, private and controlled solution. After all, with ownCloud, it’s Your Cloud, Your Data, Your Way.
